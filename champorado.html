        <h1>DISCOVER PHILIPPINES</h1>
        <p>The rainy season is upon us which means it's the perfect weather to cozy up with a bowl of heartwarming champorado.
             While it's a Filipino delicacy that's traditionally served with milk and some dried salted fish on the side,
             some have even taken it up a notch and added their own twist.
             Champorado is a sweet chocolate rice porridge that uses sweet glutinous rice (locally known as malagkit) and cocoa powder as main ingredients. 
             A more traditional approach would be using tableya (pure cocoa blocks) instead of cocoa powder.</p>
