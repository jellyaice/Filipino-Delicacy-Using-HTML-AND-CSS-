        <h1>DISCOVER PHILIPPINES</h1>
        <p>Kinilaw is a bright and tangy dish of raw fish marinated in vinegar that's indigenous to the Philippines; 
            you can think of it as a kind of ancient Filipino ceviche,
             one that celebrates the abundance of the seas surrounding the Philippine islands.
             The easiest way to describe kinilaw to the unacquainted is to compare it with the more widely known ceviche. 
             Theyâ€™re like long-lost cousins: one Filipino, the other Peruvian. Both use raw fish and a souring agent.
              Both add garnishes like chili or onions. Both have origins that can be traced back to thousands of years.
              Both have resulted in modern iterations influenced by Spanish colonization.</p>
