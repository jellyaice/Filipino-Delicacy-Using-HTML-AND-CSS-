        <p>Bicol express is a spicy Filipino stew consisting of bite sized pieces of pork with chilies,
             coconut milk, shrimp paste, onions, tomato and garlic.
             The dish is named after the train in the Bicol region of the Philippines, known for its spicy food.
             Bicol Express–despite its name being specific to the Bicol region–is popular almost everywhere here in the Philippines.
              It is a common dish you’ll find from the local karinderya to some fancy restaurants.
              And with this, everyone has their own variation of the dish usually adjusted to their own liking.</p>
