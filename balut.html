        <h1>DISCOVER PHILIPPINES</h1>
        <p>Balut is a fertilized developing egg embryo that is boiled or steamed and eaten from the shell.
             It is commonly sold as street food in South China and Southeast Asian countries, notably the Philippines, Cambodia and Vietnam.
             The term comes from the Filipino language.
             It is considered an aphrodisiac that is commonly paired with a cold beer on the side.
              The dish can be seasoned with chili, garlic, vinegar, salt, lemon juice, ground pepper, and mint leaves.
               It can also be cooked in omelets or used as a filling for pastries.
             Although balut is closely associated with Filipino cuisine and has achieved popularity throughout the world,
              it is still considered a poor man's meal in the Philippines.</p>
