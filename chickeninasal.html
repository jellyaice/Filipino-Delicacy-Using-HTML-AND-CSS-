        <h1>DISCOVER PHILIPPINES</h1>
        <p>Chicken inasal, commonly known simply as inasal, is a variant of the Filipino chicken dish known as lechon manok.
             It is chicken marinated in a mixture of calamansi, pepper, coconut vinegar and annatto,
             then grilled over hot coals while basted with the marinade.
             Key to this unique flavor is the native coconut vinegar and calamansi (local lime fruit) which gives it the distinct taste and smell that only an authentic Bacolod chicken inasal is known for. 
             The smoked flavor added by cooking the meat on a hot charcoal grill imbibes the marinade and makes the dish tastier.</p>
