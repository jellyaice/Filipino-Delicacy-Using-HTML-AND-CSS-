        <h1>DISCOVER PHILIPPINES</h1>
        <p>Bibingka is made of galapong (glutinos rice), coconut milk, margarine and sugar.
             It is usually served in a trimmed banana leaf.
             The banana leaf gives the Bibingka an aroma that the rice cake absorbs.
             In its simplest form, bibingka is a simple Filipino cake that consists of rice flour and water.
              It was initially prepared in clay pots that were lined with banana leaves, which would impart a distinctive,
               smoky flavor to the dish. Bibinka is believed to have appeared under the foreign culinary influence,
              and the first written reference describing a similar cake dates back to 1751.</p>
