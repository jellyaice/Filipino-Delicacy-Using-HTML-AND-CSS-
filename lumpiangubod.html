        <h1>DISCOVER PHILIPPINES</h1>
        <p>Lumpiang ubod, also known as heart of palm spring rolls, is a Filipino appetizer consisting of julienned ubod (heart of palm) with various meat and vegetables in a thin egg crÃªpe.
             It is commonly served fresh (as lumpiang sariwa), but it can also be deep-fried.
             Lumpia comes in many forms and I chose this fresh lumpia because it looked amazing.
              Additionally, I could make it compliant with the Plant Paradox diet that I am on with just a few tweaks.
                Lumpia is ubiquitous in the Philippines an it most popular fried.
                 Fried lumpia recipes are easily found and all I can say is they are heavenly and found at every Filipino party. 
             They are basically a small spring roll that is filled with vegetables and/or minced meats. 
              The fillings choices are endless as is the dipping sauce.</p>
