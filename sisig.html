        <h1>DISCOVER PHILIPPINES</h1>
        <p>A popular favorite in our country is sisig, which is comprised of a pig’s face that’s been chopped up and fried to perfection.
             Crispy, tangy, and meaty, it’s a perfect complement for beer’s natural earthy flavors.
              While its high fat and sodium content can make you dizzy and bloated, none of that matters once you’re three bottles in to drowning your frustrations with your douche ex in between mouthfuls of sizzling sisig.
              Sisig, the Filipino street food of chopped pig parts and chicken livers tossed with a spicy and sour dressing, is said to have originated in Pampanga,
               a province centrally located on the island of Luzon in the northern Philippines, although the dish was very different from what's commonly served today.</p>
