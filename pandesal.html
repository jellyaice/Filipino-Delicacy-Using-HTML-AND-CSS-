        <p>Pandesal is best when served hot and freshly baked from the oven. Many enjoy eating pandesal dipped into hot coffee in the morning for breakfast. 
            It can also be enjoyed with butter, cheese, jam, or as a sandwich, and enjoyed as a snack any time of the day.
            Modern pandesal and other wheat-based foods flourished in the Philippines when the price of American wheat became cheaper than rice. According to the Manila-based food site Pepper,
             wasn't until the Spaniards attempted to "create an answer to the French baguette" that the original pandesal was born.</p>
