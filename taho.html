        <p>aho is a Philippine delicacy made of silken tofu, sago (tapioca) pearls and thick sugar syrup called arnibal.
             This popular street food is commonly peddled on the streets in large aluminum buckets and is often served warm.
             The people from Baguio City took advantage of the abundance of strawberries in their area. Since they're able to make use of the fruit for other products like ice cream and jam, they thought of another way to add it to more Filipino favorites.
