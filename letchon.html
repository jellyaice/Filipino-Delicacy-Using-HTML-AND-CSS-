        <h1>DISCOVER PHILIPPINES</h1>
        <p>Lechon, derived from a Spanish word for roasted suckling pig is one of the most popular dishes in the Philippines.
             The slowly-roasted suckling pig is usually stuffed with lemongrass, tamarind, garlic, onions, and chives,
             and is then roasted on a large bamboo spit over an open fire.Unlike other roast pig dishes of other cuisines, 
             the Philippines' lechon is known for its skin. The perfect lechon skin is cooked evenly and remains smooth and shiny. 
             The best ones feature skin that remains crisp for several hours!</p>
