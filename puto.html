        <h1>DISCOVER PHILIPPINES</h1>
        <p>Puto bumbong is a type of Filipino purple rice cake which is prepared by steaming ground purple rice mixture inside a bamboo tube.
            The tube is referred to as “bumbong ng kawayan” in Filipino. 
            This might have been the reason why this was named as such.
            It originates from the province of Pampanga and Batangas.
             Sayongsong – also known as sarungsong or alisuso, they are steamed ground mixture of glutinous rice, regular rice, and young coconut or roasted peanuts, with coconut milk, sugar, and calamansi juice.
