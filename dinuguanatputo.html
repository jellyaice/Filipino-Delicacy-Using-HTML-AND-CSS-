        <h1>DISCOVER PHILIPPINES</h1>
        <p>Dinuguan at puto is considered as a good meal combination for most Filipinos.
             This refers to pork blood stew and steamed rice cake. 
             The pork is sauteed in garlic and onions. Water, vinegar, and pork blood are added and then cooked until it becomes nice and thick. It is best eaten by dipping (or scooping) the blood stew using steamed rice cake (or what is called puto in Filipino) and eating both together.
             inuguan can also be served without using any offal, using only choice cuts of pork.  
            It can also be made from beef and chicken meat, the latter being known as dinuguang manok (chicken dinuguan). 
            Dinuguan is usually served with white rice or a Philippine rice cake called puto.
             Puto is usually served as a  side dish for Pig’s Blood Stew (“Dinuguan”) or  eaten for breakfast dipped into or paired with a cup of hot coffee or hot chocolate.
